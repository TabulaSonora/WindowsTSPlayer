/// A session, a render thread and a ring, wired together.
///
/// The division of labour is the whole point, and it is upstream's: the render thread pulls blocks
/// from the session and writes them to a ring; the audio callback copies out of that ring and does
/// nothing else -- no allocation, no lock, no engine code. A slow block eats into the ring's lead
/// rather than glitching the device.
///
/// Two different boundaries meet here, and they are deliberately not the same mechanism:
///
///  - **Control** (load, settings, seek, transport) takes `lock_`, which the render thread also
///    holds while it renders a block. These are rare, they allocate, and they can throw, so a
///    mutex is the honest tool. It is safe *because* the render thread is not the audio callback.
///  - **Live MIDI** goes into a small inbox under its own mutex, held only long enough to append,
///    and swapped out wholesale once per block. A MIDI source must never wait on a block render.
///
/// Mute and solo take neither: `ChannelMask`'s flags are atomic exactly so a mixer can change them
/// while sound is running.
